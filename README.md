# Telcom-Customer-Churn-Prediction

This GitHub repository contains a project on customer churn prediction for a telco company. The project focuses on analyzing customer data to build predictive models that can classify customers as churn or non-churn. It leverages various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and GaussianNB, to identify potential churners accurately.

Key Features of This Project:

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: The repository includes code and notebooks for exploring and preprocessing telco customer data. This stage involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to prepare the data for modeling.
2. Model Development and Evaluation: It provides implementations of multiple classification algorithms to predict customer churn. The models are trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their performance.
3. Visualizations and Insights: The repository showcases visualizations and reports that summarize the model performance and provide insights into customer churn behavior. These visualizations aid in interpreting the results and making informed business decisions.

The project's insights can help businesses reduce customer churn rates, optimize marketing strategies, and enhance customer retention efforts.

# Classification Algorithms

A classification model is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that assigns data points to predefined classes or categories based on their features.

Classification models are used for tasks where the output variable (target) is a categorical value. These models learn from labeled training data to make predictions on new, unseen data. They are widely used for tasks such as spam email detection, sentiment analysis, and disease diagnosis.

In this project, we explore various classification algorithms to predict customer churn for a telco company. The goal is to classify customers into two categories: churners and non-churners. We consider algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Extra Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines, and GaussianNB.

Logistic Regression is a simple and widely used algorithm for binary classification. Decision Trees are tree-like models that split data based on features to make decisions. Random Forest and Extra Trees are ensemble methods that combine multiple decision trees for better performance. K-Nearest Neighbors classifies data points based on the class of their nearest neighbors. Support Vector Machines aim to find a hyperplane that best separates different classes. GaussianNB is a probabilistic algorithm based on Bayes' theorem.

Each algorithm has its strengths and weaknesses, making it suitable for different types of data and tasks. Through this project, we gain insights into the strengths and limitations of each algorithm and identify the best-performing one for predicting customer churn in the telco industry.
